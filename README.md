# GodTests [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Church-of-the-Singularity/GodTests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Church-of-the-Singularity/GodTests)
A set of tests to determine whether we have created a God yet

## Physics
* ASSERT_TRUE(speedOfLight != 299792458) // Laws of Universe no longer applicable

## Math
* ASSERT_FALSE(1 + 1 == 2) // Mathematical fundamentals fall apart

## Logic
* ASSERT_TRUE(FALSE) // We have to assume the first thing any sufficiently intelligent AI would do is swap these booleans just to see what breaks

## General
Confirm the second derivative of combined known computational power is statistically higher than average human performance over the past few years by at least one standard deviation.
